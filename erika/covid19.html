            <h2>COVID-19 GUIDELINES AND EXPECTATIONS</h2>
            <span>​
                - You ensure that you, and all in your household, are in good health with no symptoms of COVID-19 (as
                listed at https://novascotia.ca/coronavirus/when-to- seek-help/#symptoms) and that you, nor anyone in
                your household, have travelled by air or out of province for at least 14 days.
                <br>
                <br>
                - Please arrive wearing a non-surgical mask. You will be required to wear this mask during your entire
                appointment. I will also be wearing a new disposable mask for each new client. Bandanas, scarfs, paper
                masks do not count. Handmade cotton or other tight woven fabric mask are allowed. If you do not have a
                mask I will have them available for a fee.
                <br>
                <br>
                -Please be on time for your appointment, If the waiting area is at full capacity when you arrive head
                straight back to studio #7 and knock on the door.
                <br>
                <br>
                -Guests are not permitted within the procedure area at this time. Someone can meet you in the lobby
                after your appointment. Only you - the client, and I - the artist are permitted in the studio procedure
                area.
                <br>
                <br>
                -Once inside, before sitting down, you will be asked to wash your hands at my handwashing sink up to
                regulations standards.
                <br>
                <br>
                - Aftercare will be available to be emailed/DM’d/ or you can take a photo of the laminated shop copy.
                <br>
                <br>
                - Cash is still my preferred method of payment, paypal invoicing/etransfers will be available if
                handling cash is uncomfortable.
                <br>
                <br>
                - No outside food or drink i.e fast food, Tim Hortons, starbucks etc. if you’d like to bring a water
                bottle or snack for break-time, please bring it in one (1) closed bag or purse. You will be asked to
                step outside the procedure area to take off your mask and only permitted back in when wearing the mask
                again.
